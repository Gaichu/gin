Just a little weekend time filler. I hope you have fun playing it either way ^-^

# credits
* Inspiration and reused Code for wall generation (see map.lua): ftr (great game) by DestructiveReality (http://github.com/VADS/)
* Programming: Gaichu
* Gaichu Art: Created with http://8biticon.com/
* Capsule and Father ElHuron Art and Spin Sound: ElHuron (https://github.com/ElHuron)

please note: ElHuron appeared and will appear in every single game in some way, because ElHuron is so awesome! ≧(´▽｀)≦

# todo
